# Sparse_coding_Feature_mapping

The project includes the code for feature generation from Gaze data of a chest X-ray using Sparse represenation technique. The Gaze data is collected using a Tobii Eye Tracker for chest X-ray images. 

Using sparse representation, the important patterns that represent the gaze of a radiologist for a given image can be obtained. TensorFlow is used for the purposes of this project.
